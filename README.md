# Use-of-Multiple-Linear-Regression-to-Predict-House-Prices
This notebook explains how to perform multiple linear regression to predict regional house prices.

This model is used to undertand the factors that impact house prices in a specific regional area.  The specific data set provided is related Australian house prices (housing.csv).  The object of the model is to provide guidance on expected house prices so that an individual or company can identify homes that are priced below their expected value.
 
To solve this problem I buld a mulitple linear regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

The goal was to identify:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

- How well those variables describe the price of a house.

I also sought to determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

This modeling technique is also useful for explaining the price dynamics of this housing market.

This approach could be applied to similar problems from any geography.

Feel free to leave comments and questions,

Thanks, Mark
